# Changelog — TestPrune.Core

## Unreleased

## 6.1.0 - 2026-07-18

- fix: **`runProcessWith` bounds the test-run wait (AUTOMATION-98).** A wedged test
  runner can no longer block the CLI forever: `WaitForExit` is bounded (default
  30 minutes, `TESTPRUNE_TEST_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` to override), and on expiry the process
  tree is killed with a diagnostic and a POSIX-`timeout(1)`-style exit code 124. On a
  healthy run this behaves exactly like the previous unbounded wait.

## 6.0.0 - 2026-07-15

- feat!: **SchemaVersion 7→8** (`route_handlers` left the core schema). This is the
  number `TestPrune.Core` and `fshotwatch.cli` must agree on: it stamps the cache
  database, and on a mismatch core DELETES and recreates the file. A legacy DB is
  therefore recreated on first open — which is free, because plugin tables are
  re-created on demand by their owner and Falco's routes are re-seeded every run.
  Any consumer pinned to an older `TestPrune.Core` must be upgraded in lockstep.
- feat!: drop the route concept from the public API. HTTP routes are not a core
  concept — core has no business knowing what a URL is — so `RouteHandlerEntry`
  (`AstAnalyzer`), the `route_handlers` table and its five `Database` methods
  (`RebuildRouteHandlers`, `GetAllRouteHandlers`, `GetRouteHandlersForSourceFile`,
  `GetUrlPatternsForSourceFile`, `GetAllHandlerSourceFiles`), and `RouteStore` /
  `toRouteStore` (`Ports`) are GONE. They now live in TestPrune.Falco, which owns
  its own table. BREAKING CHANGE: seed routes with
  `TestPrune.Falco.RouteStore(toPluginStore db)` and construct `FalcoRouteExtension`
  with it.
- feat!: `Ports.PluginStore` + `Ports.toPluginStore` — the generic seam that replaces
  them. An extension whose facts are seeded from outside the AST gets a connection to
  core's cache database (`Database.OpenConnection`) and owns its tables end to end.
  Core owns the FILE: a `SchemaVersion` mismatch deletes and recreates it, dropping
  plugin tables with it, so a plugin must issue `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` before
  every use and store only what it can re-derive. Taking a live `Database` is what
  makes the seam safe — the version check has already run before a plugin sees the
  connection.
- feat!: `EdgeEmission` — the shared, tested edge-emission helper every extension
  should build its edges with. `edgesTo` emits an edge from each dependent to the
  specific symbol it depends on across the boundary: scoped to the symbol the fact
  names (`NamedSymbol`), degraded to the whole candidate set when it names none
  (`UnnamedSymbol`) or names one that no longer resolves — never a cross-product,
  never empty. Both shipped bugs came from a plugin hand-rolling this step
  (TestPrune.Falco 2.0.3 over-selected; TestPrune.SqlHydra under-selected). Scoping
  to the direct symbol is safe because `QueryAffectedTests` is a recursive transitive
  reverse-walk, which the docs now say out loud.
- feat!: `Extensions.AffectedTest` moved to TestPrune.Falco — it only ever described
  that extension's route-matched test classes; nothing in core consumed it.
- feat!: `TestPrune.Coverage.ingestCobertura` and `fileCoverageSummary` now return
  named records (`CoverageIngestSummary` = `{ Ingested; Skipped }`, `FileCoverageSummary` =
  `{ Covered; Total }`) instead of anonymous records. BREAKING CHANGE: callers that bound
  the result and read its fields need no change; callers that constructed or annotated
  the anonymous type do. Found by turning TestPrune's own `TP001` analyzer on TestPrune
  (AUTOMATION-124): an anonymous record has no stable cross-build name, so impact
  analysis could not see a caller's coupling to these public return shapes — the exact
  blind spot the analyzer ships to warn consumers about.
- feat: new `TestPrune.SafeWalk` — THE one walker for every "files under this root"
  job. Never descends a reparse-point directory (termination is structural, not
  heuristic), prunes `bin`/`obj`/`.git`/`.jj`/`.devenv`/`.direnv`/`node_modules`
  during traversal, and is depth-capped as a belt against cycles that could evade the
  symlink guard. `SearchOption.AllDirectories` is banned in this codebase — route
  every repo-scale walk through `SafeWalk.enumerateFiles`.
- fix: **a file with a misplaced `///` doc comment was silently dropped from the
  symbol graph, so editing it selected NO tests.** `extractResults` refused a file
  whenever `FSharpParseFileResults.ParseHadErrors` was set. Under the
  TransparentCompiler — which is how FsHotWatch's daemon builds its checker
  (`FSharpChecker.Create(useTransparentCompiler = true)`) — FCS sets that flag for a
  file whose ONLY parse diagnostic is **informational**: FS3520 "XML comment is not
  placed on a valid language element" has severity `Info`, and the legacy compiler
  leaves `ParseHadErrors` unset for the very same file. Such a file compiles cleanly
  and its ParseTree is complete, yet it was refused wholesale — contributing no
  symbols, so a change to it had nothing to diff, selected no tests, and the gate
  reported green having run nothing relevant. Silent under-selection: the one failure
  mode a test-impact tool must not have (see `EdgeEmission`). The guard now gates on
  the diagnostics' **severity** (`Error` and nothing else), which is the honest
  question — "is this tree trustworthy?" — rather than on a flag whose meaning varies
  by compiler backend. A real syntax error is still refused. The old message was
  misleading too: it printed *every* diagnostic under the heading "Parse errors",
  which is how an `Info` came to be reported as an error in the first place.
  (AUTOMATION-113)
- fix: **directory walks no longer follow symlinks, and no longer hang forever.**
  `discoverTestProjects` used `SearchOption.AllDirectories`, which FOLLOWS DIRECTORY
  SYMLINKS. In a devenv/nix repo the reachable tree contains self-loop symlinks
  (`ncurses-6.6-dev/include/{ncurses,ncursesw} -> .`), and each one DOUBLES the path
  count per level, so a walk that reaches one is effectively non-terminating. This
  silently wedged `fshw check` — observed at 8h36m with no output, no timeout, no
  error and no test ever launched. Scoping the walk to a narrower root (the old
  `discoverTestProjects` comment claimed "only scans tests/ to avoid .devenv/ symlink
  issues") is NOT protection: `tests/*/bin` holds Playwright's Nix-store browser
  symlinks, so the walk escapes into /nix/store from inside `tests/` anyway.

## 5.0.0 - 2026-07-11

- feat!: function-scoped route attribution. `RouteHandlerEntry` gains a
  `HandlerFunction: string option` field and `RouteStore` gains
  `GetRouteHandlersForSourceFile`, so a route can carry the handler function that
  serves it (`None` preserves prior behaviour). Adds a `handler_function` column
  to the `route_handlers` table (SchemaVersion 6→7 — a legacy DB is recreated).
  BREAKING: the new record field means every `RouteHandlerEntry` construction
  site must set `HandlerFunction`.

## 4.3.0 - 2026-06-16

- feat: dependency-fingerprint project-fanout — a dependency/PackageReference
  change selects all tests in transitively-dependent test projects (superset of
  the symbol graph). New `ProjectFanout` module: `ProjectInfo`,
  `computeDependencyFingerprint`, `diffFingerprints`, `affectedTestProjects`,
  `selectTestsForChangedProjects`. Closes the gap where a NuGet/PackageReference
  bump changes a project's binary behaviour without touching any F# symbol, so
  the symbol diff was empty and dependent tests were skipped. Source-symbol edits
  stay symbol-precise; only dependency/binary changes get the project-scoped
  fanout (never a run-all).

## 4.2.3 - 2026-06-16

- fix: editing a test's own body now re-selects that test for impact analysis.
  `Database.QueryAffectedTests` seeded its transitive closure only from symbols
  that *depend on* the changed symbol, so when the changed symbol *was* the test
  method (a node with no incoming edges), it returned no affected tests — the
  edited test was never re-run and a prior failure stayed pinned red. The closure
  now includes the changed symbols themselves, matching the in-memory reference
  store (`InMemoryStore.QueryAffectedTests`), which already did.

## 4.2.2 - 2026-06-12

- fix: the AST impact analyzer preserves dependency edges when two bindings share a
  short name across sibling nested modules (e.g. `let f` in `module A` and `module B`
  in one file). Previously the by-name range maps collapsed to last-write-wins, so a
  use inside one binding could resolve to the other binding's symbol — mis-attributing
  or dropping its dependency edges and silently failing to select affected tests (a
  soundness violation). Each name now maps to a list of ranges and is disambiguated by
  the range containing the use.
- fix: `stripComments` correctly handles triple-quoted strings. A triple-quoted string
  containing an odd number of embedded `"` (e.g. `"""3\" inches"""`) previously desynced
  the single-quote string tracker, letting a trailing `//` comment leak into the content
  hash and producing a phantom "changed" signal on comment-only edits. Triple-quoted
  content is now treated as literal until its closing `"""`.
- fix: failures reading a test process's redirected stdout/stderr surface the original
  IO exception instead of an `AggregateException` wrapper, so the real error type is
  preserved.

## 4.2.1 - 2026-06-07

- feat: `Database.SchemaVersion` is now public. External read-only consumers (e.g.
  FsHotWatch's `fshw dead-code`) probe a live DB's `PRAGMA user_version` against it
  before opening, since `Database.create`'s recreate-on-mismatch self-healing would
  wipe a daemon's symbol graph; a hardcoded copy of the constant silently inverts
  that protection whenever the schema bumps.

## 4.2.0 - 2026-06-05

- feat: `Database.WasRecreated` reports whether the on-disk DB was freshly created,
  or recreated because its schema version no longer matched, as opposed to a
  compatible reopen. This lets consumers detect a silent schema-bump rebuild — where
  the symbol graph is wiped to empty — and invalidate sibling caches keyed to the old
  graph. Without it, an external check-cache that short-circuits re-indexing keeps
  skipping files after a schema change, leaving the symbol graph permanently partial.

## 4.1.0 - 2026-06-04

- feat: TestPrune-native edit-aware coverage. Coverage from a Cobertura report is
  stored in the symbol DB keyed by `(symbol, line_offset)` instead of absolute line,
  so it survives source edits — a symbol that moves keeps its coverage (lines
  re-derive from the symbol's current `line_start`), and a symbol whose content
  changes has its coverage purged on the next `RebuildProjects`. New public API: the
  `TestPrune.Coverage` module (`parseCobertura`, `ingestCobertura`, `emitCobertura`,
  `fileCoverageSummary`) and `Database` members `RecordCoverage`, `RecordCoverageBatch`,
  `FindSymbolContainingLine`, `GetFileCoverage`, `GetCoveredFiles`. Each covered line
  is attributed to its nearest preceding declaration (TestPrune symbols are
  declaration-point markers), and a whole report ingests in a single transaction.

## 4.0.3 - 2026-06-02

- fix: the AST impact analyzer no longer aborts on un-nameable F# symbols. `FSharpEntity.FullName`/`TryFullName` can throw (`NullReferenceException` in compiled projects, `InvalidOperationException` in scripts) on symbols such as anonymous-record projections; these are now caught and the offending edge is skipped, so a single un-nameable symbol degrades impact selection slightly instead of crashing the whole analysis pass.

## 4.0.2 - 2026-05-27

- chore: update external NuGet dependencies — Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.5→10.0.8,
  Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub 10.0.201→10.0.300. Pinned FSharp.Core to 10.1.204
  (was floating `10.1.*`, which drifted to 10.1.300 and broke restore: FSharp.Compiler.Service
  43.12.204 hard-pins FSharp.Core to `[10.1.204]`).

## 4.0.1 - 2026-05-04

- fix: detectChanges now filters extern symbols from both sides internally, eliminating phantom diffs on warm FCS restart
- fix: namespace entities are no longer misclassified as Type symbols in tryClassifyEntity, eliminating +1 phantom symbol rows

## 4.0.0 - 2026-04-25
- fix: schema forward-compat. `openCheckedConnection` now treats
  `user_version > SchemaVersion` as "leave it alone" (a newer process wrote
  this DB; older code must not clobber). The `Database` constructor's
  user_version stamp gate flipped from `<>` to `<` so the marker never
  regresses. Without this, an older client opening a daemon's newer DB would
  erase the version marker, then the daemon would hit "no such column" on its
  next flush.
- api: `Database.deleteCacheFiles` (formerly `private deleteDbFiles`) is now
  public. Plugins recovering from schema drift should call this — it deletes
  the main DB along with WAL/SHM sidecars in one shot, preventing the
  "0-byte main DB after partial cleanup" failure mode.
- feat: aggregate-type invalidation (schema v5). Editing any member of a type
  now invalidates consumers that touched any part of it. Module siblings are
  excluded. v4 databases auto-recreate on open.
- feat: direct test-method → fixture-type edges via primary-ctor params and
  `IClassFixture<T>`/`ICollectionFixture<T>` interfaces. Catches fixtures the
  test never references in-body.
- feat: xUnit `[<Collection("name")>]` bridges to `[<CollectionDefinition>]`
  via a synthetic symbol, resolving cross-file through the extern pipeline.
- feat: `[<DependsOnFile>]` / `[<DependsOnGlob>]` (new `TestPrune.Attributes`
  package) seed selection from non-F# file changes. New
  `SelectionReason.FileDependencyChanged` surfaced on `TestSelectedEvent`.
- feat: entity-level attributes are now captured in `symbol_attributes`
  (previously only member-level).
- api: `ImpactAnalysis.selectTests` now takes a `SymbolStore` instead of
  three loose callbacks. Use `Ports.toSymbolStore db` to migrate.
- api: `SymbolStore.GetParentLinksInFile`, `Database.GetParentLinksInFile`.
- api: `AnalysisResult.ParentLinks` field, `SymbolParentLink` record.
- api: `AstAnalyzer.SyntheticCollectionPrefix` literal.

## [3.0.2]
- fix: `openCheckedConnection` now recreates the DB when `user_version = 0`
  *and* the file already contains user tables. The previous `version <> 0 &&
  version <> SchemaVersion` guard treated `0` as a fresh-DB signal, which let
  any pre-versioning DB survive open with its legacy schema intact (CREATE
  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is a no-op on existing tables). The constructor would
  then stamp the current `SchemaVersion`, and the very next INSERT crashed
  with `"no column named …"` — the plugin-host-level symptom was a permanent
  hang. Regression test `recreates database with user_version=0 and legacy
  tables` covers the fixture.
- revert: removed the `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)` added after
  `RebuildProjects` commits. It was introduced to mask a cross-connection
  visibility issue observed in integration tests, but the actual culprit
  was Microsoft.Data.Sqlite's connection pool caching stale reader state,
  which the checkpoint only partially papers over. Consumers that need
  deterministic visibility across in-process connections should call
  `SqliteConnection.ClearAllPools()` (or open a fresh
  `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder.Pooling = false` connection) before
  reading. Removes a per-commit round-trip and a misleading comment.

<!--
  The bullets below document changes that shipped in 3.0.0/3.0.1 but were
  never rolled out of [Unreleased] at the time. Left here for triage — they
  should be moved to the correct versioned section, not to 3.0.2.
-->
- fix: bump `SchemaVersion` 3 → 4. The 3.0.0 release introduced
  `dependencies.source`, `symbol_attributes`, and `symbols.is_extern` under
  the same v3 stamp that 2.0.0 used, so any DB written by 2.0.0 survived
  `openCheckedConnection` (version matched) and then crashed on the first
  INSERT with `"table dependencies has no column named source"`. Plugin
  hosts (FsHotWatch, etc.) deadlocked because the plugin never reached
  terminal status. Bumping forces auto-recreate of any stamped-v3 DB on
  open.
- fix: `RebuildProjects` now preserves incoming dependency edges when a file is re-indexed
  incrementally. The old code did `DELETE FROM symbols WHERE source_file IN (...)` which,
  combined with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `dependencies.to_symbol_id`, destroyed every edge
  from other (non-re-indexed) files pointing into the re-indexed file's symbols — causing
  `QueryAffectedTests` to return 0 even when dependent tests clearly existed. Now uses
  UPSERT (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT(full_name) DO UPDATE SET …`) to preserve row ids for
  surviving symbols. Orphan cleanup is timestamp-driven: every symbol touched this pass
  gets `indexed_at = now`; a single `DELETE … WHERE source_file IN (…) AND indexed_at < @now`
  sweeps away symbols that genuinely disappeared from source. Extern inserts use a
  conditional UPSERT (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET indexed_at = excluded.indexed_at WHERE
  symbols.is_extern = 1`) so they bump their own timestamps without overwriting real
  symbols. Includes regression test `re-indexing library file preserves incoming edges
  from non-re-indexed tests`.
