# Changelog — TestPrune.Falco

## Unreleased

- AUTOMATION-86: **a route with no path text of its own no longer matches the F#
  comment token.** `urlPatternToRegex` admitted a leading `/` so a doubled separator
  still read as a path start. For the root route `/` — whose whole pattern is that one
  separator — the two combined to match `//`, which is how F# opens a comment, and `^`
  let a file-opening `// license header` do the same. The route therefore matched every
  commented line in the repo.

  Measured on the consumer this was built for: route `/` matched 4,886 comment openers
  (`// `, `/// `, and their bare-line forms) against 43 real URL literals, so a
  one-line landing-page edit selected **60 of 61** integration test classes — every
  other handler file selected between 0 and 20. It is now 13, and the exhaustive
  per-file diff over all 32 handler files adds nothing anywhere and changes no other
  file's selection at all.

  Nothing that evidences the route is lost: every quoted literal (`"/"`, `"/?lang=en"`,
  `'/'`) still matches, because a quote opens it. The guard is scoped to patterns with
  no literal text of their own (`/`, and param-only routes like `/{lang}`) rather than
  applied to every route — across the consumer's other 175 route patterns the `/`
  alternative changed no file's outcome, but losing a match is the dangerous direction,
  so a route with text of its own keeps the broader boundary.

## 3.1.1 - 2026-08-17

- docs: **route→test attribution is what makes `[<TestPrune.CompositionRoot>]` safe,
  and this release states the limit.** TestPrune.Core can now be told to stop
  propagating relevance through an application's composition root, which is only sound
  while some *other* attribution still reaches the tests covering a changed handler.
  This extension is that other attribution — it links each route to the tests that name
  its URL, independently of the composition edge.

  The gap to know about: a test that reaches a route by **clicking** rather than by
  naming the URL (`page.ClickAsync "#stop-impersonating"`) is not attributed here, so
  the composition-root barrier would drop it. Measured on the consumer this was built
  for, 29 of 32 handler files were fully attributed and the three misses were exactly
  those click-driven browser tests. **Do not mark a composition root in a repo whose
  browser tests navigate by UI interaction** until this extension attributes
  click-driven navigation. Core's per-project fail-safe bounds the damage but does not
  close it.

  No API or behaviour change in this package — the source diff since 3.1.0 is comment
  rewrites only. Released to move the `TestPrune.Core` dependency floor onto the
  version that has composition-root support.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-08-05

- AUTOMATION-223: resolve Falco route non-literal navigation, dependency-free


## 3.0.2 - 2026-07-26

- fix: **A class must show evidence that it holds tests to be selected
  (AUTOMATION-86).** 3.0.1 made module selection depend on a test attribute but
  left every `type X(...)` unconditionally selectable, so fixtures and helpers
  were still returned as affected "test classes" — in the intelligence consumer,
  `IntegrationTestFixture`, `TestServer` and `BrowserErrorTracker`. Selecting one
  runs nothing on the filter path, and on the edge path fabricates test→handler
  edges out of fixture members that `QueryAffectedTests`' transitive reverse-walk
  then amplifies into every test touching the fixture. Classes and modules now
  share one rule: a span is selectable when it carries a test attribute, or —
  classes only — an `inherit` clause, because xUnit also runs test methods a base
  class declares. Two safe-direction guards come with it: a `FactAttribute`
  subclass (`[<SkippableFact>]`, `[<WindowsTheory>]`) now counts as a marker, and
  an `inherit`ing class with no marker of its own stays selectable. Merely
  implementing `IClassFixture`/`ICollectionFixture`, or being a
  `[<CollectionDefinition>]` marker, is not evidence. The conservative fallback is
  unchanged: a URL matched outside every selectable span still selects all of the
  file's test declarations, so a test reaching the route only through a fixture
  constant is never dropped. A file whose only declarations are fixtures now
  contributes nothing — there is no test in it to run.

## 3.0.1 - 2026-07-18

- fix: **Route→test selection is per-declaration, not per-file (AUTOMATION-86).** A
  matched test file no longer selects every class and module it contains: only test
  classes and test-bearing modules whose own span matches the route URL are selected,
  with a conservative fallback — any match outside every selectable span (file header,
  a shared URL-constant/helper module) selects all of the file's test declarations, so
  a test that exercises the route only indirectly is never dropped. Non-test helper
  modules (fixtures, URL holders) are never returned as affected. Test attributes are
  recognized only inside `[<...>]` blocks — combined lists like
  `[<Trait("a","b"); Fact>]` included — so attribute-like names in ordinary code
  (`[ users; TestCase(1) ]`) can no longer make a helper module selectable and
  suppress the fallback. Known residual (documented in the code): a literal `>]`
  inside an attribute string argument closes the block early and can hide a
  module-style test's only marker.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-07-15

- fix: **`findTestFiles` no longer hangs forever.** It scanned the integration-test
  directory with `SearchOption.AllDirectories`, which follows directory symlinks —
  and `tests/*/bin` holds Playwright's Nix-provisioned browser symlinks, so the walk
  escaped into /nix/store and reached its self-loop symlinks (`ncurses -> .`), which
  double the path count per level. Effectively non-terminating. Because this runs
  inside `FindAffectedTestClasses`, it hung impact analysis itself: `fshw check`
  logged `QueryAffectedTests: 1964 affected tests` and then went silent for hours
  without ever launching a test. Now walks via `TestPrune.SafeWalk`, which never
  traverses a symlinked directory and prunes `bin`/`obj` during traversal rather than
  filtering them out afterwards.
- feat!: TestPrune.Falco owns the route table. `RouteHandlerEntry` and a new
  `RouteStore` type (its own `route_handlers` table, created on demand inside
  TestPrune's cache database through core's `Ports.PluginStore` seam) live here now,
  not in TestPrune.Core — the core engine no longer carries any HTTP/route/URL
  concept. BREAKING CHANGE: seed with `RouteStore(toPluginStore db).Rebuild entries`
  instead of `db.RebuildRouteHandlers entries`, and pass that `RouteStore` to
  `FalcoRouteExtension` instead of `Ports.toRouteStore db`. `AffectedTest` (returned
  by `FindAffectedTestClasses`) also moved here from `TestPrune.Extensions`.
- fix: an unresolvable `HandlerFunction` no longer drops a route's edges. A seed
  naming a handler that has since been renamed or moved used to scope to zero symbols
  and emit nothing, so that route's tests silently stopped being selected —
  under-selection. It now falls back to the file-level match, like `None` does. This
  is core's shared `EdgeEmission.edgesTo`, which `AnalyzeEdges` now builds every edge
  with; the function-scoped behaviour (and its regression tests) is unchanged.
- feat: `RouteStore.Rebuild` is atomic — a rejected entry rolls the whole re-seed back
  rather than leaving the route table half-written.
- chore(deps): refresh to TestPrune.Core 6.0.0 (SchemaVersion 8). Core's `route_handlers`
  table and route API are gone; Falco now owns that table through `Ports.PluginStore`.

## 2.0.4 - 2026-07-11

- fix: function-scoped route edges. `AnalyzeEdges` now links each route's tests
  to that route's *handler function* (via `RouteHandlerEntry.HandlerFunction`)
  instead of the whole changed file's symbols × all-its-routes' tests
  cross-product, so a one-function change to a multi-route handler no longer
  over-selects every route's browser tests. Falls back to the prior file-level
  behaviour when `HandlerFunction` is `None`; no under-selection, since ordinary
  call deps are still caught by TestPrune.Core's transitive symbol graph.
- chore(deps): refresh to TestPrune.Core 5.0.0.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-06-25

- feat: `FalcoRouteExtension` — route-based integration-test selection. Maps a changed Falco handler file to the integration tests that exercise its routes by scanning test sources for URL patterns (including `{param}` placeholders), pulling those tests into TestPrune's impact set.
- chore(deps): refresh to TestPrune.Core 4.3.0.
