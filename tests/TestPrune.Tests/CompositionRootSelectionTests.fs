module TestPrune.Tests.CompositionRootSelectionTests

// AUTOMATION-86 — a one-line handler edit must not select the whole integration
// suite, and the fix must not buy that by dropping tests.
//
// THE SHAPE, measured on the real intelligence graph (2026-08-14, 29 906 symbols):
//
//     Handlers.AdminJournal.translate          the edited handler
//       ← RouteEndpoints.productHandler        the match arm naming EVERY handler
//       ← LabRouteEndpoints.endpoints
//       ← TestServerFixture.TestServer.BuildAndStartOnce
//       ← TestServer.Start                     boots the entire application
//       ← TestServerPool → IntegrationTestFixture / BrowserTestFixture
//       ← 57 test classes / 537 test methods
//
// Every edge on that path is TRUE. `productHandler` really does reference
// `translate`, and the fixture really does boot the app. What is false is the
// conclusion — that editing one handler makes all 537 tests relevant. The graph
// cannot tell "wires X up" from "calls X", so the composition root is marked and
// the walk declines to propagate relevance THROUGH it.
//
// THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO AVOID. Narrowing selection is the direction that
// silently ships bugs: a selection test passes just as happily when the selector
// returns nothing. So every narrowing assertion here is paired with the SAME
// query over the SAME graph without the marker, which must return the full set.
// That pairing is the positive control — it proves the selector can still report
// presence, so an empty answer is a failure rather than a pass.
//
// Both stores are exercised on every case. `Database` is what ships (FsHotWatch
// calls `db.QueryAffectedTests` directly); `InMemoryStore` is what the soundness
// harness measures. If they disagree, the harness is grading a selector nobody
// runs — so `both stores agree` is asserted case by case.
