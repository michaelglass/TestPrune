module TestPrune.Tests.SoundnessHarnessTests

// Makes "impact selection is reliable" a MEASURED property.
//
// The dangerous direction is UNDER-selection: a green impact-filtered run that
// skipped the one test which would have caught the bug. Over-selection only
// costs time. So the property under test is one-sided:
//
//     selected ⊇ truly-affected
//
// Two things make this a real check rather than a restatement of the code:
//
//   1. THE ORACLE IS INDEPENDENT. `trulyAffectedTests` walks the generated
//      graph with its own breadth-first search. It does not call the store's
//      `QueryAffectedTests`, so this is not TestPrune agreeing with itself — a
//      closure bug in the store makes the two disagree, which is the point.
//
//   2. IT IS RANDOMISED over generated graphs, so it explores shapes (diamonds,
//      cycles, long chains, disconnected islands, tests depending on tests) that
//      a hand-written corpus would not think to include. The seed is fixed and
//      printed with any failure, so a counterexample is reproducible.
//
// `RunAll` is trivially sound — it runs everything — so it always satisfies the
// property. That is deliberate: the harness must never pressure anyone into
// narrowing a conservative fallback, which would be a soundness REGRESSION
// dressed up as an improvement.
//
// Scope, in two layers, because they grade DIFFERENT things:
//
//   • The GRAPH-LAYER property below builds its `AnalysisResult` directly and
//     grades the store's transitive closure and `selectTests`' plumbing. It does
//     NOT grade extraction: `analyzeSource` is never called, so a binding form
//     the analyzer fails to see is absent from both the store AND the oracle,
//     and is structurally invisible here (AUTOMATION-223). Saying it grades
//     "impact selection" would overclaim.
//
//   • The EXTRACTION-INCLUSIVE property (further down) closes exactly that gap:
//     it emits real F# SOURCE, runs it through `analyzeSource`, and takes its
//     oracle from the GENERATION PLAN rather than from anything the analyzer
//     produced. A symbol or edge the analyzer drops therefore shows up as
//     under-selection — the AUTOMATION-268 bug class, which the graph layer
//     cannot reach.
//

//   graph. TestPrune.Falco handles that case; this harness does not prove it.
// - Fixture edges and `[<DependsOnFile>]`/`[<DependsOnGlob>]` seeds: exercised
//   incidentally by `selectTests`, but not generated adversarially here.
// - The real-suite sweep (mutate real code, run the full suite, diff against
//   selection) — a separate, much slower job.
// - BINDING-FORM BREADTH. The extraction-inclusive property runs real source
//   through the real analyzer, so it CAN see an extraction miss — but it can only
//   see one in a form it actually emits, and the generator emits plain
//   `let f () = g () + 1` module bindings. Operators, active patterns, interface
//   members, computation expressions and the rest of the shapes AUTOMATION-271
//   enumerated are not generated, so a defect confined to one of those is still
//   invisible. Widening the generator's repertoire is the direct next step, and
//   it is the step that would have caught AUTOMATION-268/271 outright; it is
//   listed here rather than claimed, because a harness that overstates its reach
//   is the exact failure this file exists to avoid.
